# Near field communication overview


Android-powered devices with NFC simultaneously support three main modes of operation:

1.  **Reader/writer mode**, allowing the NFC device to read and/or write passive NFC tags and stickers.
2.  **P2P mode**, allowing the NFC device to exchange data with other NFC peers; this operation mode is used by Android Beam.
3.  **Card emulation mode**, allowing the NFC device itself to act as an NFC card. The emulated NFC card can then be accessed by an external NFC reader, such as an NFC point-of-sale terminal.
