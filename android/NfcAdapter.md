# Near field communication overview


Android-powered devices with NFC simultaneously support three main modes of operation:

1.  **Reader/writer mode**, allowing the NFC device to read and/or write passive NFC tags and stickers.
2.  **P2P mode**, allowing the NFC device to exchange data with other NFC peers; this operation mode is used by Android Beam.
3.  **Card emulation mode**, allowing the NFC device itself to act as an NFC card. The emulated NFC card can then be accessed by an external NFC reader, such as an NFC point-of-sale terminal.


# NFC basics

This document describes the basic NFC tasks you perform in Android. It explains how to send and receive NFC data in the form of NDEF messages and describes the Android framework APIs that support these features. For more advanced topics, including a discussion of working with non-NDEF data, see  [Advanced NFC](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/advanced-nfc.html).

There are two major use cases when working with NDEF data and Android:

-   Reading NDEF data from an NFC tag
-   Beaming NDEF messages from one device to another with  [Android Beamâ„¢](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/nfc#p2p)

Reading NDEF data from an NFC tag is handled with the [tag dispatch system](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/nfc#tag-dispatch), which analyzes discovered NFC tags, appropriately categorizes the data, and starts an application that is interested in the categorized data. An application that wants to handle the scanned NFC tag can [declare an intent filter](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/nfc#filtering-intents) and request to handle the data.
