### Transient Properties

Properties declares in a managed object subclass are called  _transient_  because they are not stored in a database. For example, consider an  `Author`  type that stores first and last name as separate columns. Instead of redundantly storing a 'full name' in the database

```dart
class Author extends ManagedObject<_Author> implements _Author {
  String get name => "$firstName  $lastName";
  set name(String fullName) {
    firstName = fullName.split(" ").first;
    lastName = fullName.split(" ").last;
  }
}
```
By default, a transient property is ignored when reading an object from a request body or writing the object to a response body (see the guide on  [serialization](https://aqueduct.io/docs/db/serialization/)  for more details). 

> âš¡ You can annotate a transient property with  `Serialize`   so that it is able to be **read from a request body**, **written to a response body**, or both. For example:

```dart
class Author extends ManagedObject<_Author> implements _Author {
  @Serialize()
  String get name => "$firstName  $lastName";

  @Serialize()
  set name(String fullName) {
    firstName = fullName.split(" ").first;
    lastName = fullName.split(" ").last;
  }
}
```

### Example: One-to-Many Relationship

#### An author has many books:
```dart
class Author extends ManagedObject<_Author> implements _Author {}
class _Author {
  @primaryKey
  int id;

  String name;

  ManagedSet<Book> books;
}

class Book extends ManagedObject<_Book> implements _Book {}
class _Book {
  @primaryKey
  int id;

  String name;

  @Relate(#books)
  Author author;
}
```
#### To insert an author and a book associated with that author:
```dart
final authorQuery = Query<Author>(context)
  ..values.name = "Fred";
final author = await authorQuery.insert();

final bookQuery = Query<Book>(context)
  ..values.name = "Title"
  ..values.author.id = author.id;
final book = await bookQuery.insert();
```
#### To fetch authors and their books:
```dart
final query = Query<Author>(context)
  ..join(set: (a) => a.books);
final authors = await query.fetch();
```
To fetch a book and their full author object:
```dart
final query = Query<Book>(context)
  ..where((b) => b.id).equalTo(1)
  ..join(object: (a) => a.author);
final books = await query.fetch();
```
