# Creating AuthServers to Authenticate and Authorize

> âš¡ An  `AuthServer`  is a service that handles 
> - creating 
> - verifying and 
> - refreshing 
> authorization tokens. You create an  `AuthServer`  in your application channel and inject into types that deal with authorization. 

This types include:

-   `Authorizer`: middleware controller that protects endpoint controllers from unauthorized access
-   `AuthController`: endpoint controller that grants **access tokens**
-   `AuthCodeController`: endpoint controller that grants authorization codes to be **exchanged** for access tokens

An  `AuthServer`  must persist the data it uses and creates - like client identifiers and access tokens. Storage is often performed by a database, but it can be in memory, a cache or some other medium. Because of the many different storage mediums, an  `AuthServer`  doesn't perform any storage itself - it relies on an instance of  `AuthServerDelegate`  specific to your application. This allows storage to be independent of verification logic.



## Creating Instances of AuthServer and AuthServerDelegate

`AuthServerDelegate`  is an interface that an  `AuthServer`  uses to handle storage of client identifiers, tokens and other authorization artifacts. An  `AuthServer`  must be created with a concrete implementation of  `AuthServerDelegate`. Aqueduct contains a concrete implementation of  `AuthServerDelegate`  that uses the ORM. It is highly recommended to use this implementation instead of implementing your own storage because it has been thoroughly tested and handles cleaning up expired data correctly.

This concrete implementation is named  `ManagedAuthDelegate<T>`. It exists in a sub-package of Aqueduct and must be explicitly imported. Here's an example of creating an  `AuthServer`  and  `ManagedAuthDelegate<T>`:

```dart
import 'package:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart';
import 'package:aqueduct/managed_auth.dart';

class MyApplicationChannel extends ApplicationChannel {  
  AuthServer authServer;
  @override
  Future prepare() async {
    final context = ManagedContext(...);
    final delegate = ManagedAuthDelegate<User>(context);
    authServer = AuthServer(delegate);
  }
  ...
}
```
While `AuthServer` has methods for handling authorization tasks, it is rarely used directly. Instead, `AuthCodeController` and `AuthController` are hooked up to routes to grant authorization tokens through your application's HTTP API. Instances of `Authorizer` secure routes in channels. All of these types invoke the appropriate methods on the `AuthServer`. Here's an example `ApplicationChannel` subclass that sets up and uses authorization:

```dart
import 'package:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart';
import 'package:aqueduct/managed_auth.dart';

class MyApplicationChannel extends ApplicationChannel {
  AuthServer authServer;
  ManagedContext context;
  @override
  Future prepare() async {
    context = ManagedContext(...);
    final delegate = ManagedAuthDelegate<User>(context);
    authServer = AuthServer(delegate);
  }
  @override
  Controller get entryPoint {
    final router = Router();
    // Set up auth token route- this grants and refresh tokens
    router.route("/auth/token").link(() => AuthController(authServer));
    // Set up auth code route- this grants temporary access codes that can be exchanged for token
    router.route("/auth/code").link(() => AuthCodeController(authServer));
    // Set up protected route
    router
      .route("/protected")
      .link(() => Authorizer.bearer(authServer))
      .link(() => ProtectedController());
    return router;
  }
}
```
