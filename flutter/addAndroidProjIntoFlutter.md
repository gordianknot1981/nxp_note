### Flutter/Android 專案目錄結構說明

file structure of a flutter project would be look like this
- 📁 FlutterProject
	- 📰 pubspec.yaml 
	- 📁 lib [1]
	- 📁 android [2]
	- 📁 res [3]
>[1]  libraries written in dart.
[2]  an android project wrapper for flutter, which contains following structure
> - 📁 app
	- 📰 build.gradle
	- 📰 local.properties 
>- 📁 res
>- 📁 assets
>- 📰 build.gradle
>- 📰 settings.gradle
>
>[3] android resource folder for flutter project,  generated by flutter.

### 說明Android Project wrapper for flutter
#### android project wrapper for flutter
- 📁 app[^1]
	- 📁 libs
	- 📁 src
	- 📰 build.gradle [^2]
- 📁 res[^4]
- 📁 assets[^5]
- 📰 build.gradle[^6]
- 📰 settings.gradle[^7]

[1] 現有的android project，需將其folder改名為app，app似乎為flutter默認的android專案名稱，以告知flutter專案設定的位置(build.gradle, settings.gradle)，如果不用默任的名稱似乎也可以，但需要設定project.name及include name，後文會寫到。

 android project folder, this would be your existing android project renamed to "app".  "app" seems like a default naming convention for flutter to indicate project entry folder where configurations(build.gradle and local.properties) locates. For not using convention name, you need to setup project name and include name in build.gradle, which will refer later on.
