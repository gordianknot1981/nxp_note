	- 📰 local.properties 
>- 📁 res

### 說明Android Project wrapper for flutter
#### android project wrapper for flutter
- 📁 app[^1]
	- 📁 libs
	- 📁 src
	- 📰 build.gradle [^2]
	- 📰 local.properties [^3]
- 📁 res[^4]
- 📁 assets[^5]
- 📰 build.gradle[^6]
- 📰 settings.gradle[^7]

[1]  android project folder, this would be your existing android project renamed to "app".  "app" seems like a default naming convention for flutter to indicate project entry folder where configurations(build.gradle and local.properties) locates.
