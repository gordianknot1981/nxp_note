### Flutter/Android 專案目錄結構說明

file structure of a flutter project would be look like this
- 📁 FlutterProject
	- 📰 pubspec.yaml 
	- 📁 lib [1]
	- 📁 android [2]
	- 📁 res [3]
>[1]  libraries written in dart.
[2]  an android project wrapper for flutter, which contains following structure
> - 📁 app
	- 📰 build.gradle
	- 📰 local.properties 
>- 📁 res
>- 📁 assets
>- 📰 build.gradle
>- 📰 settings.gradle
>
>[3] android resource folder for flutter project,  generated by flutter.

### 說明Android Project wrapper for flutter
#### android project wrapper for flutter
- 📁 app[^1]
	- 📁 libs
	- 📁 src
	- 📰 build.gradle [^2]
	- 📰 local.properties [^3]
- 📁 res[^4]
- 📁 assets[^5]
- 📰 build.gradle[^6]
- 📰 settings.gradle[^7]

[1] 現有的android project需要將其改名為app並放在這裡，app似乎為flutter android project folder, this would be your existing android project renamed to "app".  "app" seems like a default naming convention for flutter to indicate project entry folder where configurations(build.gradle and local.properties) locates.
